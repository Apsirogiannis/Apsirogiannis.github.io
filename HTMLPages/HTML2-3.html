        <ol type=I>
            <li>Define the Problem
                <ul>
                    <li>This step involves gathering the requirements of the program needed to solve the problem.</li>
                    <li>Questions that should be answered</li>
                    <ol type=a>
                        <li>What data do we need to process?</li>
                        <li>How should we process the data?</li>
                        <li>What output should the program deliver</li>
                        <li>How should the user interface look?</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>

            <li>Design the Program</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Program design focuses on breaking down the program into smaller, more manageable components. Various tools are used to help design a program.</li>
                <li>Commonly used tools:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Structure Charts</li>
                    <li>Algorithm</li>
                    <li>Flow Charts</li>
                    <li>Decision Tables</li>
                    <li>Pseduocode</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Code the Program</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the program has been designed, a developer then writes the code.</li>
                    <li>Coding often involves translating the design from charts and pseduocode into a specific programming language. Usually the language is chosen during the "defining" stage</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Testing and Debugging</li>
            <ul>
                <li>After code has been written this stage revolves around fixing any bugs in the program.</li>
                <li>There are two kinds of errors that cause bugs:</li>
                <ol type=a>
                    <li>Syntax Errors: These are like grammatical mistakes in the code.</li>
                    <li>Logical Error: These mistakes might cause an other than intetnded output but the code still works</li>
                </ol>
                <li>The programmer must fix these mistakes by carefully examining the already written code for errors.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <li>Documentation</li>
            
            
            <li>Deploying and Maintaining the program</li>

        </ol>
